## **📝 Introduction**  

### **Why This Project?**  
The **Stack Overflow Developer Survey** is one of the **largest** and **most comprehensive** datasets on software development. By analyzing this dataset, we can:  
✅ Identify the **most popular programming languages** & tools.  
✅ Understand how **AI is shaping developer workflows**.  
✅ Explore **salary trends & job satisfaction**.  
✅ Identify **developer frustrations & challenges**.  

---

## **📊 Dataset Overview**  

### **📥 Data Source:**  
🔗 The dataset was downloaded from **[Stack Overflow's Official Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/)**  

### **📂 Structure of the Dataset:**  
- **65,437 responses** from developers worldwide 🌍  
- **114 columns** covering:  
  - 🌐 **Programming languages, frameworks, and tools**  
  - 🤖 **AI adoption & trust in AI-generated code**  
  - 💰 **Salaries & job satisfaction**  
  - 🚀 **Learning resources & Stack Overflow usage**  

---

## **🛠️ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  

### **🔎 Steps Taken:**  
1️⃣ **Checked for Missing Values**  
   - Many columns had **high missing values** (e.g., `AINextMuch less integrated`, `EmbeddedAdmired`).  
   - **Dropped columns** with **>50% missing data**.  
   - **Filled missing categorical values** with `"Unknown"`.  
   - **Filled missing numerical values** with **median values**.  

2️⃣ **Checked for Duplicates**  
   - **Removed all duplicate rows** to avoid redundancy.  

3️⃣ **Fixed Data Types**  
   - Converted **salary & experience** fields to **numeric values**.  
   - Standardized categorical values (e.g., `"Yes"`, `"yes"`, `"YES"` → `"yes"`).  

4️⃣ **Ensured Data Consistency**  
   - Fixed multi-select fields (e.g., **split languages & tools** into separate counts).

## **📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  

### **1️⃣ Developer Demographics**  
📌 **Age Distribution**  
- Most developers are aged **18-34 years**.  
- **Fewer older developers**, showing **a younger workforce in tech**.  

📊 **Education Level**  
- Majority hold a **Bachelor’s or Master’s degree** 🎓  
- Some **self-taught** developers & bootcamp graduates.  

---

### **2️⃣ Popular Programming Languages & Frameworks**  
📌 **Most Used Languages**  
- **Python, JavaScript, and SQL** remain the top languages.  
- **Rust, Go, and TypeScript** are gaining popularity.  

📌 **Most Wanted Languages**  
- Developers want to learn **Rust, TypeScript, and Go**.  

---

### **3️⃣ AI Usage & Trust in AI**  
📌 **AI Integration in Development**  
- **75% of developers** use **AI-powered tools** (ChatGPT, Copilot).  
- **Trust in AI varies**—some rely on AI, others are skeptical.  
- Some developers worry AI will **replace jobs** 🤖💼  

---

### **4️⃣ Developer Frustrations & Productivity Challenges**  
📌 **Top Challenges Faced**  
- **"Poor documentation", "tight deadlines", "legacy code"** are common frustrations.  
- Many developers spend **30-60 mins daily** searching for solutions.  

📊 **Word Cloud of Developer Frustrations**  


---

### **5️⃣ Stack Overflow Usage & Learning Trends**

📌 **How Developers Learn?**
- Most rely on Stack Overflow, online courses, and documentation 📚
- AI-powered learning tools are growing in adoption.

📌 **How Often Do Developers Visit Stack Overflow?**
- 50% visit daily or multiple times per day.
- Some rely on private documentation instead.

---

### **💡 Conclusion & Insights**

✅ AI is transforming development but trust in AI remains mixed.
✅ Python, JavaScript, and SQL remain dominant, but Rust & TypeScript are the future.
✅ Salaries increase with experience but plateau after 20+ years.
✅ Developers face major challenges with tight deadlines & outdated code.
✅ Stack Overflow & online courses are still essential learning resources.
